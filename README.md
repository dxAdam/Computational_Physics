# Computational Physics
#### The notebook **comp_phys_python.ipynb** is meant to run in Jupyter Notebook. Github shows the static output of notebook cells that were ran before pushing, but does not show the animations (which are the coolest parts). 
Installation of Jupyter Notebook, Python, and the Anaconda Distribution is covered __[here](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html#installing-jupyter-using-anaconda-and-conda)__ .
