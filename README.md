# Computational Physics
The notebook **physics_notebook.ipynb** runs in Jupyter Notebook.<br>
Github shows some of the static output but does not show the widgets or animations (which are the coolest part).<br> 
Installation of Jupyter Notebook, along with Python and the Anaconda Distribution is covered __[here](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html#installing-jupyter-using-anaconda-and-conda)__ .
