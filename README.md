# Computational Physics
The notebook **physics_notebook.ipynb** runs in Jupyter Notebook.<br><br>
Github shows some of the static output but not the widgets or animations (which are the coolest part).<br><br>
Installation of Jupyter Notebook, along with Python and the Anaconda Distribution is covered at the __[Jupyter website](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html#installing-jupyter-using-anaconda-and-conda)__ .
